Another period of cold may be helpful to encourage remaining seeds to sprout. Alternatively, seed may be exposed to outdoor winter conditions for germination in the spring
    WarmMoistStrat = 5,        // Warm, moist stratification required for 3 to 4 months, followed by 2 to 3 months cold stratification during which germination takes place while cold. Expose to warmth when germination is complete
    Ferns = 6,                 // Germination of fern spores â€” sterilize soil medium with boiling water, sow spores and keep moist with plastic or glass. A green film (prothalli) develops in several weeks, followed by baby ferns which can be transplanted when big enough to handle
    Orchids = 7                // Germination of orchid seeds requires specialized equipment -- consult a reference
